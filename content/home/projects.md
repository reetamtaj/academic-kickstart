**IDEaS, Aug 2019 - Dec 2019**
- The project falls under the umbrella - “Understanding Cyber Intent”. 
- A Context-Aware and Machine Learning Framework was presented to Predict, Detect and Differentiate Cyber-Attacks. The proposed framework   includes three modules, a cognitive module for detecting known attacks against existing attack signatures, an adaptive module for generating alerts, mitigating the effects of known attacks, and context-aware use of resource-intensive ML and DL tasks, and a classification module for classifying attacks with machine-learning techniques and neural networks.
- Neural Network Distillation process was implemented to interpret the learning models to update existing attack signatures of Snort.
