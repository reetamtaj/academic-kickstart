  **Project:** Department Of National Defense, Canada, Halifax
  **Funded by:** IDEas, Canada
  
  Responsibilites include:
  The project falls under the umbrella -” Understanding Cyber Intent and detecting
cyber-attacks”. As a part of this project, we are building a context aware and
machine learning framework in order to predict, detect, classify and differentiate
cyber-attacks. The proposed framework is a representation of collaborative
intrusion detection system (IDS) that comprises both Network based IDS and Host
based IDS. The designed framework will be validated on testbed with a simulation
of attacks.

  This project revolves around building a framework that securely stores user's
credentials and data generated by users of a web application. A thorough
literature survey was conducted to ensure the framework is parallel to the state of
the art . During the implementation phase, different hashing algorithms, data
encryption algorithms, key exchange techniques, and 2 factor authentication will
be implemented
